# link-in-a-chain

Each node has two sets of data. the first is the actual chainlink data, and
the second is a pointer to the next node

In order to create linked list using this code:

You must create both the chainlink and the node that holds the chain link
data

then add a new element using the addNode method with the first argument
being the current end of the list and the second argument the new node you
wish to add to the list 

print method prints all the chainlinks in the list

viewNode lets you see the information of whatever node you pass as the
argument
